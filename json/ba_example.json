Chill haze should not be perceived. Aromas typically related to beer are very low. Low fruity-ester aromas are acceptable. Diacetyl aroma should be absent. Hop aroma is absent to very low. Hop flavor is absent to very low. Hop bitterness is absent to very low. Corn, rice, or other grain or sugar adjuncts often used. These beers are high in carbonation. Flavors typically related to beer are very low. Low fruityester flavors are acceptable. Diacetyl flavor should be absent. Calorie level should not exceed 125 per 12 ounce serving.
